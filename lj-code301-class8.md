# LJ Code 301 - Day 8

Today we learned about SQL and how it communicates with the database. Couple advantages of SQL is: queries can be used to retrieve large amounts of records from a database very quickly and efficiently. Its is also used for viewing data without storing the data into the object.

SQL statements are also used to perform tasks such as update data on a database. The standard SQL commands such as "Select", "Insert", "Update", "Delete", "Create", and "Drop" can be used to accomplish almost everything that one needs to do with a database.

If you want to retrieve specific data from the table then you would use SELECT because it extracts data from a database. (* = all)  FROM table1. This will retrieve all data that is inside table1.
```
SELECT * FROM table1;
```
Rows = refer to as "RECORDS"  

Columns = refer to as "FIELDS"

There are 7 data types in SQL which are: Integer, Float, Char, Varchar, Text, Date, Time
